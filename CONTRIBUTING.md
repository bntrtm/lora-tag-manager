## Contributor Expectations

Feel free to contribute to the project! When doing so, be sure to follow the [Python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

Try to include unit tests for your feature contributions where possible under `tests/`.

Merge commits will not be accepted; when using `git pull`, please rebase your local changes onto the remote branch you are pulling, rather than making a merge commit. An efficient way to automate this process is to set up a local git configuration with the following command:

```
git config pull.rebase true
```
